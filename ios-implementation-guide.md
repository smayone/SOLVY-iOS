## Data Models

### User
```swift
struct User: Codable {
    let id: Int
    let username: String
    let createdAt: Date
}
```

### Transaction
```swift
enum TransactionType: String, Codable {
    case deposit
    case withdrawal
    case transfer
}

enum TransactionStatus: String, Codable {
    case pending
    case completed
    case failed
}

struct Transaction: Codable {
    let id: Int
    let userId: Int
    let amount: Decimal
    let type: TransactionType
    let status: TransactionStatus
    let description: String?
    let createdAt: Date
}
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Project Setup
   - Create new Xcode project with App ID: "XC S A -Nathan SS-sub-Project (S.A.-Nathan.SS-sub-Project)"
   - Set up SwiftUI as the UI framework
   - Configure API client using URLSession

2. Authentication Flow
   - Implement login/register screens
   - Set up secure token storage using Keychain
   - Handle session management

3. Main Features
   - Dashboard with transaction summary
   - Transaction list with filtering
   - New transaction creation
   - Charts and analytics

4. iOS-Specific Considerations
   - Use SwiftUI for modern UI development
   - Implement biometric authentication
   - Handle offline mode
   - Push notifications for transaction updates

5. Web3 Integration
   - Prepare for integration with solvy.chain domain
   - Consider wallet connectivity options

## Required Dependencies

1. Charts
   - SwiftUICharts or Charts framework for transaction visualization

2. Networking
   - URLSession for API calls
   - Combine for reactive programming

3. Security
   - Keychain for secure storage
   - CryptoKit for encryption

4. Additional
   - SwiftDate for date handling
   - SDWebImage for image caching
   - KeychainAccess for keychain wrapper

## Design Guidelines

1. Follow iOS Human Interface Guidelines
2. Maintain SOLVY brand identity
3. Support both light and dark mode
4. Implement dynamic type for accessibility

## Web3 Integration Guide
This guide will help you understand how to connect your SOLVY app to the blockchain world. We'll explain everything step by step, in simple terms.

### What You Need to Know First

#### What is Web3? üåê
Think of Web3 as a new kind of internet where:
- You own your data (like your profile and transactions)
- No single company controls everything
- Everything is more secure and transparent
- You can prove you own digital things (like your account)

#### What is solvy.chain? üîó
- It's like a website address (like www.google.com) but for blockchain
- Instead of .com, it ends with .chain
- It's YOUR special address for the SOLVY app
- It's more secure than regular website addresses

### How We'll Add This to Your App

#### Step 1: Getting Started üì±
First, we'll add the tools we need:
```swift
// This helps us talk to the blockchain
import Web3Swift

// Your basic setup will look like this:
class BlockchainHelper {
    // This will hold your app's connection to the blockchain
    let web3 = Web3.init()
    
    // More code will be added here as we build features
}
```

#### Step 2: Connecting to solvy.chain üîå
We'll create simple functions to use your domain:
```swift
class DomainManager {
    // This checks if solvy.chain is working
    func checkDomain() {
        // We'll add the actual code here later
        // It will be explained step by step
        print("Checking solvy.chain connection...")
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Adding a Wallet üëõ
A wallet is like a bank account for blockchain. Here's how we'll add it:
```swift
class WalletManager {
    // This will let users connect their wallet
    func connectWallet() {
        // We'll add more code here later
        // It will handle connecting to wallets
        print("Connecting to wallet...")
    }
}
```

### When We'll Build Each Part üìÖ

1. First Week:
   - Add the basic tools
   - Make sure we can connect to blockchain
   - Test that solvy.chain works

2. Second Week:
   - Add the wallet connection
   - Let users sign in with their wallet
   - Make sure everything is secure

3. Final Week:
   - Connect everything together
   - Test that it all works
   - Make sure it's ready for the App Store

### Helpful Resources üìö

#### For Beginners:
1. Start Here:
   - Watch "Intro to Web3" videos on YouTube
   - Read the Web3Swift getting started guide
   - Try some basic blockchain apps

2. Next Steps:
   - Learn about wallets
   - Understand basic blockchain security
   - Practice with test networks (they're free and safe to use)

### Keeping Everything Safe üîí

1. Protecting User Data:
   - We'll store sensitive information securely
   - Everything will be encrypted
   - We'll follow Apple's security guidelines

2. Testing:
   - We'll test everything thoroughly
   - Start with test networks (no real money involved)
   - Move to real networks only when everything is perfect

Remember: We'll take this step by step, and you can ask questions anytime! üòä
